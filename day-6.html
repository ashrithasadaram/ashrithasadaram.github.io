    <h1>DAY-6 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 6 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Implementing User Feedback</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on implementing user feedback into the design. I gathered feedback from peers on my Figma designs and made necessary adjustments. Understanding user needs and preferences is crucial in UI/UX design. I learned to use Figma's commenting feature to facilitate discussions around design elements. This iterative process of design and feedback will help create a more user-centered product.</p>
