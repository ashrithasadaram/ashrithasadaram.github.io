    <h1>DAY-11 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 11 of the project.</p>
    <h2> Enhancing Website Interactivity</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on enhancing the interactivity of my website. To make the website more interactive, I incorporated features like animations, hover effects, and responsive elements. Utilizing Lovable's capabilities, I added dynamic components that improved user engagement. I also explored best practices for performance optimization, ensuring that interactivity didn't compromise loading times. This phase underscored the balance between aesthetics and functionality in web development.</p>
