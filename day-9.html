    <h1>DAY-9 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 9 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to Lovable for Front-End Development</h2>
    <p>Today, I explored Lovable, a platform that enables building software products using a chat interface. I discovered that Lovable allows developers and non-technical users to build, edit, and optimize frontends rapidly. By defining the structure and style of a UI framework, Lovable generates scalable frameworks instantly. I experimented with creating component libraries and design systems, appreciating how Lovable simplifies front-end development by integrating AI-driven tools.</p>
