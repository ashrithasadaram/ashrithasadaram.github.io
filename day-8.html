    <h1>DAY-8 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 8 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Creating Interactive Prototypes</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on creating interactive prototypes in Figma. I learned how to use Figma's prototyping features to link different screens and create a flow for user testing. This involved adding interactions, transitions, and animations to make the prototype feel more realistic. I also gathered feedback from peers on the prototype, which will be valuable for making further improvements.</p>
