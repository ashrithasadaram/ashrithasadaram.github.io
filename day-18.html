    <h1>DAY-18 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 18 of the project.</p>
    <h2>finalized backend requirments</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on finalizing the backend requirements for the project. This involved reviewing the data models, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms. I collaborated with the team to ensure that all necessary features were included and that the backend architecture would support the frontend needs. We discussed the database schema and made adjustments based on feedback from the frontend team. This step is crucial for ensuring a smooth integration between the frontend and backend components.</p>
