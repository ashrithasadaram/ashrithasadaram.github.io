    <h1>DAY-7 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 7 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Designing Floor Plans in Figma</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on designing floor plans. I utilized Figma to create floor plans for my project. Using the Figarc library, I accessed pre-made components tailored for floor plan designs. This streamlined the process, allowing me to draft layouts efficiently. I learned to maintain consistency across designs by using standardized symbols and guidelines. Collaborating with peers became seamless, as Figma supports multiple designers working on the same project simultaneously. This experience highlighted Figma's versatility beyond traditional UI design. </p>
