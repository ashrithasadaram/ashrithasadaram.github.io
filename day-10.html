    <h1>DAY-10 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 10 of the project.</p>
    <h2> Developing Front-End Using Figma Designs and Lovable</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on developing the front-end using the designs created in Figma and the capabilities of Lovable.Integrating Figma and Lovable, I began developing the front-end of my project. I imported my Figma designs into Lovable, which facilitated the generation of responsive code. This synergy between design and development tools accelerated the workflow, reducing manual coding efforts. I customized components and adjusted layouts, ensuring the final product aligned with the initial designs. This approach emphasized the importance of cohesive design-development integration.</p>
