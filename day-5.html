    <h1>DAY-5 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 5 of the project.</p>
    <h2> Exploring Figma for UI/UX Design</h2>
    <p>Today, I ventured into Figma, a powerful tool for UI/UX design. I created a free account and familiarized myself with the interface. Learning about frames, components, and design systems was intriguing. I practiced designing simple interfaces, experimenting with typography, color schemes, and layout grids. Figma's collaborative features stood out, allowing real-time collaboration and feedback. This tool will be instrumental in translating ideas into visual representations, bridging the gap between design and development.</p>
