    <h1>DAY-3 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 3 of the project.</p>
    <h2> Introduction to Git and Version Control</h2>
    <p>Today, I began my journey into version control by exploring Git. I learned that Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. I installed Git on my local machine and configured my user name and email. Understanding the basic commands like git init, git add, git commit, and git status was enlightening. I practiced creating a new repository and making commits to track changes. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for efficient collaboration and code management in future projects.</p>
