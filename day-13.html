    <h1>DAY-13 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 13 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Exploring Firestore for NoSQL Database Solutions</h2>
    <p>Today, I shifted my focus to Firestore, Firebase's NoSQL database offering. I learned about its document-oriented data model, which allows for flexible and scalable data storage. Setting up a Firestore database, I explored its querying capabilities, including real-time updates and offline support. This experience highlighted the advantages of using Firestore for modern web applications, particularly those requiring real-time data synchronization.</p>
