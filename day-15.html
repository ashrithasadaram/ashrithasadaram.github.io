    <h1>DAY-15 REPORT</h1>

    <h2>Exploring Next.js for Server-Side Rendering</h2>
    <p>Today, I delved into Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. I learned how Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications with its file-based routing system. Setting up a Next.js project was straightforward, and I appreciated its built-in features like automatic code splitting and optimized performance. I explored how to create pages, components, and API routes in Next.js, which will be beneficial for building dynamic web applications.</p>
