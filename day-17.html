    <h1>DAY-17 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 17 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Exploring API Routes in Next.js</h2>
    <p>Today, I focused on API routes in Next.js, which allow for building backend functionality directly within a Next.js application. I learned how to create API endpoints using the file-based routing system, making it easy to handle requests and responses. I experimented with different HTTP methods and explored how to connect to a database from an API route. This feature will be valuable for building full-stack applications with Next.js.</p>
