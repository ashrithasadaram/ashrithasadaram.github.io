    <h1>DAY-4 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 4 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Working with Remote Repositories</h2>
    <p>Today, I learned about the importance of remote repositories in Git. Building upon yesterday's knowledge, I delved into remote repositories. I created an account on GitHub and learned how to push my local repository to GitHub using git remote add origin and git push -u origin master. Cloning repositories with git clone and fetching updates with git pull became clear. Understanding the difference between local and remote repositories and how to synchronize them is crucial for collaborative development. I also explored branching strategies, realizing how branches facilitate parallel development without conflicts.</p>
