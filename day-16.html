    <h2>Exploring Tailwind CSS for Styling</h2>
    <p>Today, I explored Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. I learned about its class-based approach, which promotes consistency and reusability in styling. Setting up Tailwind in a project was straightforward, and I appreciated its extensive documentation and community support. I experimented with various utility classes to create responsive layouts and custom designs without leaving my HTML.</p>
