    <h1>DAY-14 REPORT</h1>
    <p>This is the report for day 14 of the project.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to Supabase as a Backend Alternative</h2>
    <p>Today,Exploring alternatives, I studied Supabase, an open-source backend-as-a-service that offers a managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time capabilities, storage, and serverless functions. I set up a Supabase project and appreciated its simplicity and the control it offers over the database. Supabase's compatibility with SQL and its real-time features make it a compelling choice for backend development. </p>
